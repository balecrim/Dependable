# Dependable

A simple as in "simple enough for anyone to understand and fix a bug in an hour" dependency injection library. We strive for maintainability and beginner-friendliness, not necessarily feature-richness.

## Instalation

 `Dependable` should be installed via Swift Package Manager.

In Xcode, go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and use the url https://github.com/balecrim/Dependable.git.
